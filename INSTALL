Installation Instructions
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Before starting the installation, please check that you have all the standard
compilation tools (gcc, make etc), gtk2-devel, glib2-devel (or similar packages)
and the gkrellm2 development files installed. The configure script does not check 
that your GTK+2 installation is valid, so make sure of this yourself!

To compile and install the plugin, do the following from inside the gkrellmbups
directory:

% ./configure
% make
% su
Password: <enter the root password>
% make install

This will make gkrellmbups available to all users on your system. If you only
need it for your user, do the following:

% ./configure
% make
% cp src/gkrellmbups ~/gkrellm/plugins/gkrellmbups.so

(note that the .so is important!). 

As something has gone wrong already (what, you mean you're reading the docs
before you have a problem? Are you mad?!?), check what config.log says
configure is barfing about. If you can't work out what is happening from 
that, wave a small dead chicken over your computer. If that doesn't help, email
me (address is in the README) and I'll see if I can help. Or at least recommend
a good band of dead chicken. Remember to send me the config.log with your 
email. Archived please, because those things get rediculously big.

By default NUT support *IS NOT* compiled into the plugin. In order to enable
NUT support you should pass the argument --enable-nut to the configure script:

% ./configure --enable-nut
..etc..

will compile GKrellMBUPS with NUT support. Remember that configure provides
a numbr of options aside from this - if you don't know what they are

% ./configure --help

may help, or it may just cause more confusion. That is what computers are for.

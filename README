Description
=-=-=-=-=-=
This plugin communicates with a Belkin Sentry Bulldog or Network UPS Tools 
server and displays various pieces of status information:

    * Input, output and battery voltages.
    * Input and output AC frequency.
    * UPS load and temperature.
    * UPS status messages.

Under NUT some or more of these variables may not be displayed, it all depends
on whether the NUT driver for your UPS can make the information available.


Notes on Mains
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Mains voltages are typically 220 to 240 in the UK, this presented some problems
with fitting any sort of meaningful data on the chart - either the chart is 
prohibitively large or any difference between the signals is swamped by the 
scale. Subtracting a value from the input and output voltages before display 
ensures that both signals will fit on the display without significant loss of 
detail on a 40/50 pixel high monitor. The Mains option in the configuration
should be approximately the same as the UPS low voltage transfer value (187v 
on a UK Belkin UPS). US users will probably want to lower this to 90 or 100v
using the option in the preferences panel.


Requirements
=-=-=-=-=-=-
To use this plugin you will need:

    * GKrellM 2+ (and the associated development files)
    * GTK+2 (and the associated development files)
    * Belkin Sentry Bulldog software (supplied with your Belkin UPS) or
      Network UPS Tools 1.2.1
    
The UPS server software must be installed and running for this plugin to 
function correctly. Note that it is possible to monitor the status of a UPS 
over a LAN (or even over the internet if you have a decent connection) so 
you can use this plugin to monitor the status of a UPS connected to another 
machine if you want. 


Upgrading
-=-=-=-=-

The major change visible to anyone who has used my plugin in the past 
(after the addition of NUT support) will be the modifications I have made 
to the preferences. This version of GKrellMBUPS will understand the chart
settings for previous versions, but you will need to check the connection
settings in the preferences otherwise the plugin may not be able to connect
to the ups server.
